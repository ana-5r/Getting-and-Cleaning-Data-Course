run_analysis.R does the following:


1. sets the working directory

2. reads the training and the test datasets

3. merges the two datasets

4. assigns variable names for the measurements

5. adds the activity and the subject who performed the activity

6. extracts the mean and standard deviation variables for each measurement

7. names the activities with descriptive activity names

=> the first tidy data set: finalData1


8. calculates the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

=> the second tidy data set: finalData2
